# 707-Final-Bike-Rental-Count
 The dataset for this brief analysis is a two-year hourly log for years 2011 and 2012 from the Capital bike sharing system 
 in Washington D.C.. The aim is to use (count) regressions to predict hourly bike rental count based on environmental and
 seasonal factors. The dates re disregarded, however the weekday, hours, months, and seasons are included as factors. We
 will begin with a brief data exploration, and then start from a simple linear regressions which we will attemp to improve,
 followed by some count models and other regressions. The dataset is available at UCI Machine Learning repository. The
 variables except "casual"(rental counts for non-subscribers) and "registered"(counts for subsribers) counts are normalized
 in the original data.
